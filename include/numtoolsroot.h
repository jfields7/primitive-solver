       * \brief Find the root of a function f using false position.
       *
       * Find the root of a generic function taking at least one argument. The first argument
       * is assumed to be the quantity of interest. All other arguments are assumed to be
       * constant parameters for the function. The root-finding method is the Illinois variant
       * of false position.
       *
       * False position works by evaluating the test function at both bounds, then looking for
       * the x-intercept of the line between these points. It typically has superlinear 
       * convergence. If one bound is drawn in toward the root more quickly than the other, the
       * method can stagnate. The Illinois variant handles these cases by forcing the intersection
       * to occur on the other side of the root if it appears on the same side twice in a row.
       *
       * \param[in]  f    The function to find a root for. It must take at least one argument.
       * \param[in,out]  lb   The lower bound for the root.
       * \param[in,out]  ub   The upper bound for the root.
       * \param[out] x    The location of the root.
       * \param[in]  args Additional arguments required by f.

       * \brief Find the root of a function f using a Newton-Raphson solver.
       *
       * Find the root of a function f with at least three arguments using a Newton-Raphson solver. It is
       * assumed that f takes three arguments. The first argument must be a reference to store the 
       * function value. The second argument must be a reference to store the derivative. The third
       * argument is the point to evaluate both the function and its derivative at. Any additional
       * arguments are assumed to be constants.
       *
       * The Newton-Raphson method is one of the standard methods for root-finding. It evaluates
       * a function f and its derivative df at a point x, then calculates the tangent line at
       * that point and predicts that the root is located at its x-intercept. For well-behaved
       * problems, it provides quadratic convergence. For poorly behaved roots, it will diverge.
       * For best results, use on functions with one well defined root and monotonic behavior.
       *
       * \param[in]     f    The function to use for the root solve.
       * \param[in,out] x    The initial guess for the root (in) and the location of the root (out).
       * \param[in]     args Any additional arguments required by f.
